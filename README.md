# 100daysofcode
In this 100 Days of Code challenge, I will aim to learn more about Seaborn and Pandas to better visualize data.

The first part of the project will consist of many small test visualizations.

The latter portion should consist of more useful visualizations utilizing some of the ONTRAPORT send logs.
